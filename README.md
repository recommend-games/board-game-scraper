### Documentation

The documentation is automatically generated from the content of the [docs directory](https://github.com/recommend-games/board-game-scraper/tree/master/docs) and from the docstrings
 of the public signatures of the source code. The documentation is updated and published as a [Github Pages page](https://pages.github.com/) automatically as part each release.

### Releasing

Trigger the [Draft release workflow](https://github.com/recommend-games/board-game-scraper/actions/workflows/draft_release.yml)
(press _Run workflow_). This will update the changelog & version and create a GitHub release which is in _Draft_ state.

Find the draft release from the
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/recommend-games/board-game-scraper/releases) and publish it. When
 a release is published, it'll trigger [release](https://github.com/recommend-games/board-game-scraper/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow which creates PyPI
 release and deploys updated documentation.

### Pre-commit

Pre-commit hooks run all the auto-formatting (`ruff format`), linters (e.g. `ruff` and `mypy`), and other quality
 checks to make sure the changeset is in good shape before a commit/push happens.

You can install the hooks with (runs for each commit):

```sh
pre-commit install
```

Or if you want them to run only for each push:

```sh
pre-commit install -t pre-push
```

Or if you want e.g. want to run all checks manually for all files:

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```
